# Make your public sector website or app accessible

How to make your public sector website or mobile app meet accessibility standards. 

## Understanding accessibility

Making a website or mobile app accessible means making sure it can be used by as many people as possible. 

This includes those with:

* impaired vision
* motor difficulties
* cognitive impairments or learning disabilities
* deafness or impaired hearing

Some disabled people use assistive technology to access online services. For example, someone with impaired vision might use a screen reader (software that ‘reads out’ the text on a website), braille display or screen magnifier. Or someone with motor difficulties might use a special mouse, speech recognition software or on-screen keyboard emulator.

In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability.

### Why it’s important

Accessible websites are better for everyone. For example, they are faster and easier to use, and appear higher in search engines.

You may also be breaking the law if your public sector website or app doesn’t meet accessibility standards.

Most public sector websites do not currently meet accessibility standards. For example, a recent study found that [4 in 10 local councils’ homepages failed basic tests for accessibility](https://www.socitm.net/press/81).

Common accessibility problems include websites that can’t be navigated using a keyboard, inaccessible PDF forms that can’t be read out on screen readers, and poor colour contrast that makes text difficult to read, especially for partially sighted people.

## What you need to do

Public sector websites and apps are required by law to:

+ meet [accessibility standards]
+ publish an [accessibility statement] - this must include anything doesn’t meet accessibility standards
+ if someone requests it, provide an accessible alternative for content that doesn’t meet the standards within a reasonable time

^ Public sector includes central government, local government, and organisations who get significant income from public funds. There are special rules for [nurseries, schools and 
charities].

## Accessibility standards

The law says you have to make your website or mobile app more accessible for disabled people by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’.

Your website or app will meet the requirements if it meets the international WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard.

In some situations you may not need to fully meet this standard for all of your website or app. This can be the case if making the changes to your website or app would cause what the law calls a ‘disproportionate burden’.

The government will be monitoring websites and apps to check they follow these rules and aren’t breaking the law.

The date that these checks start and the steps you need to take depend on whether you have:

+ a new website (published on or after 23 September 2018)
+ an existing website
+ an app

### What counts as disproportionate burden

To work out if something is disproportionate, consider things like:

+ the benefits to users with disabilities of meeting the standards
+ the cost of meeting the standards
+ how it’s used by disabled people - how often and for how long
+ your organisation’s size and resources

You can’t make a valid argument that something is a disproportionate burden because of a lack of time or knowledge, or because you haven’t given it priority.

### New websites 

New websites must usually be fully accessible and meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.

It’s very unlikely that you could make a valid argument that doing this is a disproportionate burden. This is because most modern websites, and the software for managing them, meet the accessibility standards.

The government will start checking that new websites meet accessibility standards from 23 September 2019. 

^Accessibility standards apply in the same way for apps, but government checks do not start until 23 June 2021.

We recommend that you make sure your website or app meets the standards by:

+ making sure the team or agency responsible for your website or app [understands WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20)
+ doing some [basic accessibility tests](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) before you sign off your new website or app

### Existing websites

The government will start checking that existing websites meets the accessibility standards from 23 September 2020. 

You may not have to meet the standard for your whole website if doing so would be a disproportionate burden.

We recommend that you act now so that you:

+ make sure [new content you publish is accessible] - so you don’t have to go back and fix it
+ make a plan to meet the standards (and identify anything that’s disproportionate to fix)

If you’re not sure what would be disproportionate in your situation, talk to your legal adviser.

%You’re legally responsible for your website meeting accessibility standards, even if you’ve [outsourced your website to a supplier] (link to section below).

## Making a plan to meet accessibility standards

You‘ll need to identify which parts of your website need fixing before you can work out what to prioritise.

### Identify what you need to fix

Start by finding out which parts of your website meet accessibility standards and which parts don't. 

As well as telling you what you’ll need to fix, you’ll need this for your accessibility statement.

To work out what is and isn’t accessible, you’ll need to work with the people involved in running your website, including:

+ the team or agency that’s responsible for maintaining the website code
+ people involved with creating content
+ any other suppliers who provide forms, tools or transactions

You’ll then need to work out how you’ll identify accessibility problems. One way is to check your website using automated and manual accessibility tests. These tests will uncover many issues with code, design and content. 

But if you’re a larger organisation, you may need to pay for a full accessibility audit for a more in-depth review. These can cost between £3,000 and £7,000 depending on the size and scope of your website.

Think about the criteria for ‘disproportionate burden’ when working out which methods to use.

^The GOV.UK Service Manual has sections on automated and manual testing and getting an accessibility audit.

### Work out what to prioritise

Once you’ve identified your website’s accessibility problems, you’ll need to work out what to prioritise.

Keep in mind the criteria for ‘disproportionate burden’. For example, it’s probably of more benefit to disabled users for your organisation’s essential services to meet accessibility standards than old PDF newsletters.

And relatively cheap changes are less likely to be disproportionate. For example, a simple code change that improves your website’s colour contrast will cost much less than making your website responsive (automatically change size to fit the user’s device).

Remember that if something is a disproportionate burden, you’ll still need to make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities - for example, by providing the information they need in another format that’s accessible to them.

Talk to your legal adviser if you're not sure what to do.

### Make a roadmap

Once you’ve worked out your priorities, you can make a high level plan or roadmap to show how you’ll meet accessibility standards.

Aim to fix the highest priority things first, and think about how you’ll know when each problem has been fixed. 

## Making content accessible

Make sure new content published from 23 September 2018 meets accessibility standards. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to go back and fix it (by September 2020 for existing websites). 

Tell the people who create content on your website that they have a responsibility to make the content accessible.

This includes:

+ making sure [PDFs or other documents they create are accessible]
+ making sure images are accessible 
+ following conventions for creating accessible content (for example, write descriptive links instead of using ‘click here’) 

It’s very unlikely that making new content accessible would be considered a valid disproportionate burden.

### Making old content accessible 

Content published on existing websites before 23 September 2018 must meet accessibility standards, unless it’s a disproportionate burden.

Work out which content you need to prioritise and fix as part of your [accessibility plan].

### Exempt types of content
{#exempt-content}

You usually need to make documents like PDFs and Microsoft Office files accessible if they’re primarily intended for use on the web.

There’s an exemption if they’re both:

+ published before 23 September 2018
+ not essential for services that your organisation provides

There are also exemptions from making content accessible if it’s:

- pre-recorded audio and video published before 23 September 2020
- live video
- maps - if the map helps users find a service you offer, you must provide directions another way
- part of a heritage collection - for example, scanned manuscripts
- third party content that’s under someone else’s control if you didn’t pay for it or develop yourself - for example, social media ‘like’ buttons

There’s no legal requirement to make some types of website accessible. This applies if it’s:

- an intranet or extranet published before 23 September 2019 (until you do a major update of it)
- archived and is not needed for services your organisation provides

## Procuring an accessible website or app

Some public sector organisations have outsourced some or all of their websites to suppliers that make it very expensive to make even simple changes. If this is the case, it may be a disproportionate burden to make part of your website fully accessible. 

Where possible, we recommend that you should renegotiate your contract or change supplier. You should:

- follow [government guidance on procuring technology] (link to follow) - awarding contracts that aren’t too long and using open standards, for example, makes it easier to take advantage of technical advances that can improve accessibility
- where possible, [use web technologies rather than native mobile apps](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/working-with-mobile-technology) - because it’s easier to update web technologies
- make [meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standard] part of the request for quotation (RFQ)
- consider building regular accessibility reviews into the contract
- include accessibility as part of the contract evaluation

The European Commission has published guidance in its [Accessible ICT Procurement Toolkit](http://mandate376.standards.eu/).

## Accessibility statements

You will need to publish an accessibility statement from:

* 23 September 2019 for new websites published on or after 23 September 2018
* 23 September 2020 for existing websites
* 23 June 2021 for mobile apps

For websites, publish the statement as an html page, linked to from a prominent place like the website footer. For mobile apps, make the statement available in an accessible format where users can download the app.

The accessibility statement must say:

- which parts of your service do not meet accessibility standards and why
- how people with access needs can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible
- how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link (to be confirmed) to the government website that they can use if they’re not happy with your response 

The law says you must respond within a reasonable amount of time if someone requests information in an accessible format.

We will link to a model accessibility statement by December 2018.

## Special rules for schools, nurseries and charities

There’s no legal requirement to meet the accessibility standards for content that’s not essential for the public to use your services if you’re a school, nursery or charity.

You still need to provide alternative formats on request even if you don’t need to meet accessibility standards.

## Get support, training or advice

Depending on where you work, you may be able to get support from:
+ the [local government digital] network - you can ask questions on their accessibility Slack channel
+ the [central government accessibility community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community)

^The Government Digital Service is researching what guidance and support that public sector organisations need to meet accessibility standards. If you’re interested in taking part in this research, contact <accessibility-research@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>.

### If you’re not sure the rules apply to you

Check with your legal adviser if you’re not sure whether the accessibility rules for public sector body websites and apps apply to you. For example, if you don’t know whether your organisation is a public sector body, or whether some of your content is exempt.

Even if you’re not covered by the rules for websites and apps, the law says you can’t discriminate against people with disabilities.

All UK service providers have a legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010 (or, in Northern Ireland, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995). 

It’s not yet been tested in a UK court, but it’s common to recommend meeting accessibility standards as a way of proving that you’ve made reasonable adjustments.
