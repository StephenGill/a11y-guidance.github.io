# Publishing accessible documents

Documents published on GOV.UK or other public sector websites must meet accessibility standards. If they don’t, you could be breaking the law.

## What to do as a document author

Follow these steps when you write a document. If you have questions, contact your website team.

### 1. Keep the language simple

Write in language that’s as simple as possible.

Simple language makes your document accessible to people with cognitive impairments and learning disabilities.

And research shows that everyone prefers simple language, including specialist audiences. Because it saves time.

### 2. Keep the document simple

Documents with single, continuous columns of text are easier to make accessible than documents with a more compex layout.

Only use tables for data. Keep tables simple: avoid splitting or merging cells.

Don’t use colour alone to get across meaning.

If you’re using images, think about how you’ll make the content accessible to people with a visual impairment. Two options  are:

- make the same point in the text of the document (so people with visual impairments get the information they need - the image is there as an extra for people who are able to see it)
- give the person converting or uploading the document for you [alt text (‘alternative text’)](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) for the image

Avoid footnotes where possible. Provide explanations inline instead.

### 3. Give the document a structure

Use a sans serif font like Arial or Helvetica. Minimum size of 12 points.

Make sure the text is left aligned, not justified.

Use sentence case. Avoid all caps text and minimise use of italics.

Avoid underlining, except for links. 

Use plenty of white space. Break up your document to make it more readable. Use bullet points, numbered steps and subheadings.

Don’t use bold to mark up subheadings. Use styles to create a hierarchy of headings: ‘heading 1’, ‘heading 2’ and so on.

## Converting or uploading a document

Wherever possible, create content in HTML formats. If you need to publish a document in another format, it should be in addition to an HTML version.

If you do need to upload a non-HTML document, follow this guidance:

## Check your document before uploading

Once you’ve followed the steps to make your document accessible, check it before publishing.

### Microsoft Office 2016

Use the [accessibility checker](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-the-Accessibility-Checker-on-your-Mac-to-find-and-resolve-accessibility-issues-3b84295e-d55b-49f1-b443-523ec45a5232) found in the ‘Review’ toolbar.

### Adobe Acrobat Pro
Once you’ve converted your file to a PDF, you can [check whether it’s accessibile](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html) in Acrobat Pro.
Go to ‘Advanced’ then ‘Accessibility’ and select ‘Full check’. The PDF should pass the full check for WCAG 2.0 Level AA without any warnings.

### Quick screen reader check

Check that the document will make sense to screen reader users. 

#### Use NVDA

[Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA)](http://www.nvda-project.org/) is a free open source screen reader for Windows. It can be installed to the desktop or run from a portable USB thumb drive.

With NVDA running, open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF:

- from the top of the PDF (with the numlock off), use Numpad 0 + Numpad 2 to read the PDF from top to bottom and check the reading order
- use the tab key to move through the PDF and check the tab order
- use the h key to move through the PDF and check the heading structure
- use the g key to move through the PDF and check for text descriptions

These commands will also work with the Jaws screen reader from Freedom Scientific.

### Use VoiceOver

All Apple Macs have VoiceOver built in. Turn VoiceOver on (or off again) using Command + f5. With VoiceOver running open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF:

- from the top of the PDF use a double finger down swipe, or ‘Control + Option + a’ to read the PDF from top to bottom and check the reading order
- use the tab key (repeatedly) to move through the PDF and check the tab order.

VoiceOver does not provide shortcut keys for navigating by headings or graphics.
