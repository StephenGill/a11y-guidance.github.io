# Making your service or website accessible: an introduction

[One in 5 people in the UK have a disability](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/disability-facts-and-figures).

It’s important that those people can access public services. The public sector has a duty to serve the population as a whole. And when someone can access public services on their own terms, that’s empowering.

And meeting accessibility standards can make the public sector more cost effective. If more people can access services and information online, there’s potential to save money on answering unnecessary phone calls.

This guidance applies to public sector digital services, websites and [mobile apps](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/working-with-mobile-technology).

## Understanding accessibility

Making a service accessible means making sure it can be used by people with:

- impaired vision
- motor difficulties
- cognitive impairments or learning disabilities
- deafness or impaired hearing

Some disabled people use assistive technology to access online services. For example, someone with impaired vision might use a screen reader (software that ‘reads out’ the text on a website), braille display or screen magnifier. Or someone with motor difficulties might use a special mouse, speech recognition software or on-screen keyboard emulator.

Meeting accessibility standards means that people can use your service with assistive technology.

## Accessible services are better for everyone

Making services accessible makes them better for everyone. For example, video subtitles can help people with a hearing impairment. But they’re also useful to someone watching a video in a noisy office.

And services that meet accessibility standards tend to use less bandwidth - so they’re better for people with low wifi or a limited mobile data plan.

## Meeting accessibility standards

If your service isn’t accessible, you may be breaking the law.

The best way to meet accessibility standards is to build them into your processes. It’s much harder to go back and fix accessibility problems after the fact.

For example, make sure that anyone creating content knows that they have a responsibility to make the content accessible. And that this includes:

- using simple language
- making sure PDFs and other documents are accessible
- making sure any images, video or audio content is accessible 
- following conventions for creating accessible content (for example, write descriptive links rather than using ‘click here’ 

You’ll also need to consider:

- page design and layout
- how your HTML is structured
- how any forms and transactions work

## Procuring an accessilble website or service

Fixing an inaccessible serivce, website or mobile app after it's been built can be costly and difficult, if not impossible.

If you're carrying out a procurement related to a digital service, website or app address accessibility from the start.

The European Commission has publised guidance in its [Accessible ICT Procurement Toolkit](http://mandate376.standards.eu/).
