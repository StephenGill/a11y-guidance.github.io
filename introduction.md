## Making your service or website accessible: an introduction

[One in 5 people in the UK have a disability](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/disability-facts-and-figures).

It’s important that those people can access public services. The public sector has a duty to serve the population as a whole. And when someone can access public services on their own terms, that’s empowering.

Done right, accessible public services can be more cost effective. If more people can access services and information online, there’s potential to save money on answering unnecessary phone calls. And services that meet accessibility standards adapt better to new technologies.

## Understanding accessibility

Making a service accessible means making sure it can be used by people with:

- impaired vision
- motor difficulties
- cognitive impairments or learning disabilities
- deafness or impaired hearing

Some disabled people use assistive technology to access online services. For example, someone with impaired vision might use a screen reader (software that ‘reads out’ the text on a website), braille display or screen magnifier. Or someone with motor difficulties might use a special mouse, speech recognition software or on-screen keyboard emulator.

Meeting accessibility standards means that people can use your service with assistive technology.

You can find out more about types of impairment and assistive technology from:

- [user profiles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles) highlighting the common barriers users face when accessing digital service
- [web accessibility perspectives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) - videos showing the benefits of making services accessible

## Accessible services are better for everyone

Making services accessible makes them better for everyone. For example, video subtitles can help people with a hearing impairment. But they’re also useful to someone watching a video in a noisy office.

And services that meet accessibility standards tend to use less bandwidth - so they’re better for people with low wifi or a limited mobile data plan.

## Meeting accessibility standards

If you’re service isn’t accessible, you could be breaking the law.

Accessibility problems can be caused by:

- the language you use
- page design and layout
- code
- how any forms and transactions work
- the documents you publish

So it’s important to [check that your service or website meets accessibility standards](https://stephengill.github.io/a11y-guidance.github.io/meeting-standards.html).
